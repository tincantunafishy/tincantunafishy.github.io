 <h1>UML Diagrams </h1>
<p>UML diagrams are a blueprint for the program. They allow for the programer to  map all of the classes and their connections to one another.</p>
<p>UML diagrams can show the programmer how all classes interact and work with each other. Each class represents one  box with 3 parts:</p>
 <p>the name of the class, the class fields (name and type), and the methods (name, type, and parameters)</p> 
     
     <img src="fieldsmethods.png" alt="Fields and methods Code class="center">
     <p> Here is an example where the class name is Classrooms, the fields are numberOfChairs, numberOfTables, and students, while the methods are doWork(); and doTest(); </p>
  <h1>Associations </h1>
  <p> Associations are different ways as to how the classes relate to each other.  </p>
<h2>Association </h2>
     <p> Association is used when there are 2 classes which are somewhat related. The connection is represented by a simple line. </p>
    <img src="association.png" alt="Association Code class="center">
     <p> In this example writeAssignment and writeTest are both classes that the student does which makes them related and ultimately why association was used. </p>
    <h2>Composition </h2>
     <p> Composition is used when 1 class is dependent on another so they cannot exist without one another. The connection is represented by a diamond arrow facing the class that is made up of the other. </p>
    <img src="composition.png" alt="Composition Code class="center">
       <p> In this example administrators and facilities staff will not be possible without the school which is why composition is used </p>
     <h2>Aggregation </h2>
     <p>Aggregation is used when the classes can exist independently, but they are still made up of each other. The connection is represented by a hollow diamond arrow facing the class that is made up of the other. </p>
   <img src="aggregation.png" alt="Aggregation Code class="center">
      <p> Student and teacher can exist independently; however, they still rely on one another which is why aggregation is used. </p>
     <h2>Generalization </h2>
     <p> Generalization essentially inheritance where there is a superclass and subclasses. The subclasses have the same fields and methods as the superclass and the connection is represented with a hollow arrow pointing to the class that is more general. </p>
      <img src="generalization.png" alt="Generalization Code class="center">
       <p> General purpose is a subclass of the super class classrooms which is why generalization was used </p>
     <h2>Finished result </h2>
     <p> Here is an example of a finished UML diagram with different classes and different types of associations. </p>
