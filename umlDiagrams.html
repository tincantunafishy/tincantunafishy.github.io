 <h1 style="text-align:center;">UML Diagrams </h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">UML diagrams are a blueprint for the program. They allow for the programer to  map all of the classes and their connections to one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">UML diagrams can show the programmer how all classes interact and work with each other. Each class represents one  box with 3 parts:</p>
 <p style="text-align:center;">the name of the class, the class fields (name and type), and the methods (name, type, and parameters)</p> 
  <h1 style="text-align:center;">Associations </h1>
  <p style="text-align:center;"> Associations are different ways as to how the classes relate to each other.  </p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Association </h2>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> Association is used when there are 2 classes which are somewhat related. The connection is represented by a simple line. </p>
    <img src="association.png" alt="Association Code ">
     <p style="text-align:center;"> In this example writeAssignment and writeTest are both classes that the student does which makes them related and ultimately why association was used. </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Composition </h2>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> Composition is used when 1 class is dependent on another so they cannot exist without one another. The connection is represented by a diamond arrow facing the class that is made up of the other. </p>
    <img src="composition.png" alt="Composition Code ">
       <p style="text-align:center;"> In this example administrators and facilities staff will not be possible without the school which is why composition is used </p>
     <h2 style="text-align:center;">Aggregation </h2>
     <p style="text-align:center;">Aggregation is used when the classes can exist independently, but they are still made up of each other. The connection is represented by a hollow diamond arrow facing the class that is made up of the other. </p>
   <img src="aggregation.png" alt="Aggregation Code ">
      <p style="text-align:center;"> Student and teacher can exist independently; however, they still rely on one another which is why aggregation is used. </p>
     <h2 style="text-align:center;">Generalization </h2>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> Generalization essentially inheritance where there is a superclass and subclasses. The subclasses have the same fields and methods as the superclass and the connection is represented with a hollow arrow pointing to the class that is more general. </p>
      <img src="generalization.png" alt="Generalization Code ">
       <p style="text-align:center;"> General purpose is a subclass of the super class classrooms which is why generalization was used </p>
