 <h1 style="text-align:center;">Sorting Algorithms</h1>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> Sorting algorithms are used when the user needs to sort a list or array in a specific way. </p>
     <h2 style="text-align:center;">Bubble Sort</h2>
   <p style="text-align:center;">Bubble sort interates through a loop comparing 2 adjacent elements. If the one to the left is larger, </p>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> swap the 2 values and continue this until the end of the loop.  </p>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> Its time complexity is O(n^2) which means that although it is efficient, it is not the most efficient sorting algorithm </p>

     <p style="text-align:center;">Visual representation of how Bubble Sort works</p>  
     <img src="bubble.png" alt="Bubble sort Code" class="center">
     <p style="text-align:center;">Code representation of how Bubble Sort works</p>  
     <p style="text-align:center;"> you start by adding 2 false booleans(sorted and swapped) one for sorted and one for swapped so that the program will know when to exit. </p>
     <p style="text-align:center;">  The while is needed because as long as sorted is not true the rest of the code will run. </p>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> There is a for loop to run through all of the elements of the array, and if the element before element i is greater, the code will swap the 2 elements to ensure that they become sorted. </p>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> Afterwards the boolean swapped is true, and then swapped becomes false again. This continues until swapped is false, and then sorted would be true.  </p>
     <h2 style="text-align:center;">Insertion Sort</h2>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> Insertion sort sorts the list of elements into a sorted and unsorted array. It starts from the beginning </p>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> it takes that value and puts it into the sorted array. It will move the values as more elements get added. </p>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> This repeats until the end of the list. </p>
           <p style="text-align:center;"> Its time complexity is O(n^2) which means that although it is efficient, it is not the most efficient sorting algorithm </p>

     <p style="text-align:center;">Visual representation of how Insertion Sort works</p>  
     <img src="insertion.png" alt="Insertion sort Code" class="center">
     <p style="text-align:center;">Code representation of how Insertion Sort works</p>  
     <p style="text-align:center;"> This code starts off by declaring ints i and j, and initializing i to 1. There is then a while which says that as long as i is smaller than the array length, run what is inside of the loop.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Afterwards, the value for i is set into j. There is then another while which says that as long as j is smaller than 0 AND array at index j-1 is greater than array at index j, run the stuff inside the loop.</p>  
     <p style="text-align:center;">The swap method is then called which is where there is an int temp, which has the value of into array with index j. Then array j-1's value is set into j, and temps value is set into j-1 and the index goes down one everytime it loops the while. I will increase every time the while is left.</p>  
     <h2 style="text-align:center;">Selection Sort</h2>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> Selection sort interates through the entire list to find the smallest value and adds that to the beginning of the list. </p>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> This repeats until the entire list is sorted. This is more efficient than both bubble and insertion sort. </p>
          <p style="text-align:center;"> Its time complexity is O(n^2) which means that although it is efficient, it is not the most efficient sorting algorithm </p>

      <img src="selection.png" alt="Selection sort Code class="center">
     <p style="text-align:center;">Code representation of how Selection Sort works</p>  
     <p style="text-align:center;"> To start off there is a varible n to represent the arraylist size. Theres a for loop to ensure that all elements of the array are ran through by starting the variable at 0 and making sure its less than the arraylist size-1  </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"> The minimum index is set to the for loop variable(sortBoundary) and another for loop is implemented.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"> This for loop has a new variable(j) which is declared as sortBoundary + 1, and can go up to the arraylist size-1. If the element at index j is smaller than the element at minimum index, then the value from j becomes the new minimum index </p>
     <p style="text-align:center;">Afterwards, you need to make a new int called temp, and swap it with min index. Swap min index with sortBoundary, and set temps value to sortBoundary. </p>
     <h2 style="text-align:center;">Merge Sort</h2>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> Merge sort breaks up the entire array into subarrays and repeats until the subarrays have a size of 1. </p>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> These smaller subarrays then get merged from smallest to largest. Merge sort is much faster than bubble,</p>
     <p style="text-align:center;"> insertion, and selection; however, merge sort uses a lot more memory than the other sorting algorithms. </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;"> Its time complexity is O(n*Log n) which means it is very efficient and fast especially with large amounts of data; however since merge sort is recursion, it uses up a lot of the computers memory </p>
